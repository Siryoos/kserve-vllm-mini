**Backend**: (e.g., vLLM, TGI, TensorRT-LLM)

## Results Summary
- **P95 Latency**: X ms
- **TTFT**: X ms
- **Throughput**: X RPS
- **Cost per 1K tokens**: $X.XXXX
- **Energy per 1K tokens**: X Wh

## Configuration
\`\`\`yaml
# Paste your profile configuration or key vLLM args
\`\`\`

## Insights
- What worked well?
- Any surprises in the results?
- Lessons learned for others?

## Questions
- Looking for feedback on specific aspects?
- Areas where you need help optimizing?
```

### Troubleshooting Template
```markdown
**Issue**: Brief description of the problem
**Profile**: Which profile are you using?
**Command**: Full command you ran
**Environment**:

## Error Message
\`\`\`
Paste full error message here
\`\`\`

## Expected vs Actual
- **Expected**: What should have happened?
- **Actual**: What actually happened?
