description: "CPU-only deployment smoke test (limited functionality)"
use_cases:
  - "CPU compatibility verification"
  - "Resource-constrained environments"
  - "Development without GPU access"

# vLLM CPU configuration (very limited)
vllm_features:
  device: "cpu"
  gpu_memory_utilization: null  # Not applicable for CPU
  enforce_eager: true  # Required for CPU
  disable_custom_all_reduce: true

# CPU deployment limitations
limitations:
  quantization_support: "None - CPU does not support GPU quantization methods"
  speculative_decoding: "Not available on CPU"
  attention_backend: "Limited to basic implementations"
  performance: "Significantly slower than GPU deployment"
  memory_efficiency: "Lower efficiency without GPU memory management"

warnings:
  - "CPU deployment is not recommended for production workloads"
  - "Many vLLM features are GPU-only and will be unavailable"
  - "Expect 10-50x slower inference compared to GPU"
  - "Large models may exceed available system memory"

characteristics:
  traffic_shape: "Light load suitable for CPU limitations"
  burstiness: "Very low to avoid overwhelming CPU"
  resource_intensity: "High CPU, high system memory"
  duration_estimate: "5-10 minutes (slow CPU inference)"
  expected_results: "High latency, low throughput, frequent warnings"

recommended_alternatives:
  - "Use GPU-enabled profiles for realistic performance testing"
  - "Consider cloud GPU instances for development"
  - "Test with smaller models if CPU deployment is required"
