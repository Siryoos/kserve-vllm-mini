## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards

**Python Code**
```python
# Use type hints
def validate_profile(config: Dict[str, Any]) -> ValidationResult:
    pass

# Follow black formatting (automatic via pre-commit)
# Use descriptive variable names
# Add docstrings for public functions
```

**Shell Scripts**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail  # Always include error handling

# Use descriptive variable names
PROFILE_PATH="$1"
VALIDATION_RESULT=""

# Quote variables to handle spaces
if [[ -f "$PROFILE_PATH" ]]; then
    echo "Validating profile: $PROFILE_PATH"
fi
```

**YAML Profiles**
```yaml
# Use consistent structure
pattern: "steady"
requests: 200
concurrency: 10
max_tokens: 64

description: "Brief description of profile purpose"
use_cases:
  - "Primary use case"
  - "Secondary use case"

# Document expected impacts
characteristics:
  traffic_shape: "Steady arrival rate"
  expected_benefits: "Specific performance improvements"
```

### Testing Requirements

**Before submitting a PR:**

1. **Run validation checks**
```bash
# Code formatting and linting
pre-commit run --all-files

# Configuration validation tests
python -m pytest tests/test_validation.py

# Profile validation
./scripts/validate_config.py --profile your-new-profile.yaml
```

2. **Test with real deployment** (if possible)
```bash
# Test new profiles end-to-end
./bench.sh --profile your-new-profile.yaml --requests 50
```

3. **Update documentation**
- Add profile to feature matrix in README.md
- Update docs/FEATURES.md with new capabilities
- Include usage examples

### Submission Process

1. **Create feature branch**
```bash
git checkout -b feature/add-int4-quantization-profile
```

2. **Make atomic commits**
```bash
git commit -m "Add INT4 quantization profile with validation checks"
git commit -m "Update documentation for INT4 profile usage"
```

3. **Test thoroughly**
- Run all validation checks
- Test with multiple configurations if possible
- Verify documentation builds correctly

4. **Create pull request**
